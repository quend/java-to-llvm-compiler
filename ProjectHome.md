The only other implementation : VMKIT is hard to work with so I set out to create a compiler of my own. It currently supports a subset of java.

I request that you use it for open source purposes and not commercially. Apple's llvm compiler(https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/whats-new.html#llvm-compiler) currently supports C and C++, they have a team working on adding java support.
